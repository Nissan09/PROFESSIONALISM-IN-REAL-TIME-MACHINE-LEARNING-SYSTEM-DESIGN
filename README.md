# PROFESSIONALISM-IN-REAL-TIME-MACHINE-LEARNING-SYSTEM-DESIGN
This project presents a professional and scalable machine learning system for real-time wildfire risk detection in Brazil, developed as part of the ITS66604 - Machine Learning and Parallel Computing module at Taylor’s University. The system is designed to support real-time disaster response by classifying regions into high or low wildfire risk based on environmental and meteorological factors, using data from FireWatch Brazil (Q1 2024). Key features of this solution include thorough data preprocessing, categorical encoding, feature scaling, and the implementation of multiple classification models—primarily Random Forest and XGBoost. The project also integrates parallel computing techniques using joblib to accelerate training and optimize performance under high data load, aligning with the need for scalable solutions in real-time scenarios.
